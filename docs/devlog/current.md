Active branch: `design/crawler-auto-ingestion-readiness`

## Active Focus

NPC T1 current-schema isolated acceptance is complete; formal apply remains separately authorized follow-up.

## Open Work

- No open work in this isolated-acceptance checkpoint. Formal NPC apply and scheduler enablement remain separately authorized follow-ups.

## Current State

- NPC T2 decision `canonical-npc-t2-cutover-verification-20260806-admin-02`
  completed as a no-write operation; maintained readiness is
  `pass/formal-t2/T2_CUTOVER_VERIFIED`.
- The three item-group inputs and standardized NPC input are canonical source
  contracts; the generated NPC bridge remains retired.
- Domain acceptance is `45/0/0`, cross-DB quick is `10/10 pass`, and the full
  local quality gate passed. Isolated E2E run
  `5588e137a806de4a2dd417fe8319954d` passed and cleaned up.
- Runtime readback found no disposable E2E database, Redis DB 15 state, runner
  listener, active automation attempt/reservation, retained permit, scheduler
  daemon, or crawler process.
- NPC T1 refresh `npc-t1-20260807-01` passed against a current 129-table
  read-only snapshot; rollback/commit/restore was `0/1/0` across all three
  isolated roles, and independent cleanup readback returned all resources to zero.

## Next Agent Start Point

Audit the current `local.npc_loot_entries` count of `1880` versus the prior T1
evidence count of `1890` before generating any formal NPC apply request.

## Current Risks

- Scheduler eligibility is not authority to start a recurring daemon or crawler.
- The normal admin frontend login proxy needs a separate runtime-config review;
  final page acceptance used an authenticated backend token cookie.
- Release, deployment, push, merge, and worktree cleanup require separate user
  direction.
- Before any new runtime or release claim, rerun the relevant current gates.
- Passing NPC T1 isolation does not authorize formal writes or another domain.
